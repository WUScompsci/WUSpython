# Chapter 2, Exercise 1 - string methods and numbers:

# Referring to Example1, now write a program to do the following:
# 1) Assign the string “A picture’s worth a thousand words” to the variable called proverb
# 2) Using a method, replace the string “A picture’s” with the string “An image”
# and assing the new string to a variable called proverbImage
# 3) Find the first occurrence of the letter “o” in the original string and assign the value
# of the index to a variable called firstO
# 4) Convert the original string to uppercase and assign it to a variable called proverbUpper
# 5) Find the number of characters in the string
# 6) Display the results of all these operations, as well as the original string.

# IMPORTANT: Try to do this by yourself but if you get stuck, you may look at Exercise1b

# Referring to Example1, now write a program to do the following:

# Assign the string “A picture’s worth a thousand words” to the variable called proverb
__________ = "A picture's worth a thousand words"

# Using a method, replace the string “A picture’s” with the string “An image” and
# assing the new string to a variable called proverbImage
proverbImage = proverb.__________("A picture's","An image is")

# Display the result of the operation
print("amended proverb ",__________)

# Find the first occurrence of the letter “o” in the original string and assign the
# value of the index to a variable called firstO
firstO = proverb.__________("o")

# Display the result of the operation
print("First occurrence of 'o' is at index",__________)

# Convert the original string to uppercase and assign it to a variable called proverbUpper
proverbUpper = proverb.__________()

# Display the result of the operation
print("Uppercase string :",__________)

# Find the number of characters in the string. Display the result of the operation
print("Length of string =",_______(proverb))
