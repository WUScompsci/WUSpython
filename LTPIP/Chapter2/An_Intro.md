# Chapter 2: Introduction to Strings and numbers

The data types you will use in Python are:

### String
Strings are alphanumeric (often called text) so any letters, numbers or symbols can be used. Remember, if something looks like a number but is actually a string then you wonâ€™t be able to do anything mathematical with it
### Integer
Whole numbers (no decimal point) e.g. 3
### Float
Numbers with a decimal point e.g. 3.0 (you might see these called real numbers)
### Boolean 
The result of a boolean equation is always True or False
