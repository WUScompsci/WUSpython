# Chapter 2, Exercise 5

# Use the internet to find out the latest conversion rate for GB Pounds (£) to Euros (€).
# Write a program to ask the user to enter the number of Pounds they want to take on
# holiday and convert this into the equivalent amount in Euros.
# NB to get the € symbol on a windows keyboard hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys and press 4.

# Extension: Improve the above program so that it will tell you how many 50, 20, 10 and 5 Euro notes you would receive to make the correct number of GB Pounds.
