# Chapter 2 - String methods:

Python uses ‘methods’ -  a method is written using the 'dot' notation, 
Example:   the string.upper(firstName)
1) the name of the object on the left, followed by a full-stop (eg. string.  )
2) then the method name, followed by parentheses(____)  (eg.   .upper()  )
3) then in parentheses the object (often a variable) the method is applied to (eg.  (firstName)

## Reminder!! 
A method is a function that “belongs to” an 'object'. An object consists of data and/or behaviour.
A method defines a particular behaviour of the object.  

In the examples below ‘string’ and 'firstName' are just the name of the objects, like:
# string.upper(___)	  string.lower(___)      firstName.lower(___)     string.find(___)  
# string.replace(____)   firstName.replace(____)   astring.index(_____)
