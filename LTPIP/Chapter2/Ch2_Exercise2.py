# Ch 2 Exercise 2 radius and circumference

# Write a program to ask the user to enter the radius of a circle and
# print out the area, as well as circumference.  
# You might need to go online to find out what formula is needed to calculate
# circumference.

#TIP: The Python code for exponent is ** (eg. 2^3 is 2**3). Calculate the area of a circle using PI*r^2

PI = _____________

# convert the input to a float and assign it to a variable
__________ = ____________(input("Enter radius of circle: "))

# Calculate the area of the circle
print("Area is",________________________)

# Calculate the circumference of the circle
print("Circumference is",_____________________)
