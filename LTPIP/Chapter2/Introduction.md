# Chapter 2: Introduction to Strings and numbers

In this course uses 3 main sources:
1) Most of the examples, questions and exercises are from the 'Learning to Program in Python' book that our school has bought multiple copies of.  You can use the booklet as your primary source.
2) The Youtube tutorials below are very useful and I will be using them regularly throughout this course.
